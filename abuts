        <h3>Teuta Elezaj - Founder and President, C.S. with a Minor in Mathematics</h3>
        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Teuta Elezaj and I am a junior studying Computer Science! My parents immigrated here from Kosovo and I am a first-generation American and college student. I originally enrolled at SJU as a BioMed major, but I quickly realized it wasn't the path for me. It took me about a year to have the guts to change my path, but I've been a CS student for 3 semesters now and I have finally found passion in my work. Being that I have been in a couple of different STEM fields, and in high school I was also in a STEM program, I've been around men for the vast majority of my life and have been confronted with several different instances of misogynistic conduct and comments. I hope that this club can serve as a safe space for you all to thrive and succeed, and I want us to create an environment where motivation is a permanent feeling!
          I have a cat that I adopted about four months ago and a younger brother! My current  career goal is to be a software engineer, and in the future I hope to integrate my passion for business with my coding abilities. Weightlifting is a huge passion of mine and in my free time, I'm usually working on a coding project (like this website!) or watching Survivor!</p>

        <h3>Reyan Al Taee - Vice President, Biomedicine</h3>
        <p>Hey everyone! my name is Reyan and I’m a junior majoring in BioMedical Sciences. I got into St. John’s as a pharmacy major but while working at a pharmacy I realized I wanted to know beyond that this patient will be receiving this medication. I wanted to interact with patients and know what exactly is this drug doing to their system and if its not working what alternatives are available. I am also the public relations chair of the badminton club. I am currently working with professor Charles Fortmann, who is a physics professor that graduated from Stanford, teaching little kids physics at a school close to campus and soon will be working on his research that is making essential products from scratch that will be helping Puerto Rico to function day to day activities. I’m also pursuing a minor in psychology and that is mainly because I’m very intrigued by how the mind works. In all the extracurricular activities that I do, one thing I realized is the huge gap between men and women participation. I hope to see an increase in women in the research programs and so on. I love languages. I speak three languages and I am currently trying to learn Turkish. I love watching romance shows like Turkish series and k-dramas. I also love reading books, fiction as well as nonfiction. I love watching sunrises and sunsets and going on long drives alone. P.S. sunrises are prettier and calmer than sunsets! </p>

        <h3>Sofya Ignatyeva - Secretary, Biology</h3>
        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Sofya and I am a biology major with aspirations to work hands on in the medical field as a physician. I think it is necessary to break stereotypes of woman not being able to take control and lead the way in medicine . In my free time I love to work out and travel whenever there is time. I also work in a private medical office and I try my best to assist and get a look at the medical field to learn what needs to be adapted and changed for the greater good. I’m so glad to meet everyone and hopefully we can all make a change!</p>

        <h3>Marlin Medina - Treasurer, Computer Science</h3>
        <p>Hi everyone! I’m Marlin and I’m a Computer Science major. I was born in the Dominican Republic but I grew up here in NY. I’ve really enjoyed learning to code and am looking forward to continue to grow in this field of study. This past summer I did an internship at a reinsurance company where I learned much about the industry and encountered many of the challenges that women face in male dominated fields. The truth is that most executive roles at companies are held by men and it can be pretty intimidating but I hope that this club can be a community where we can all talk about these challenges. In my free time I like to read, travel, bake and visit new places. Hope to meet you all soon! </p>

        <h3>Sidorela Zefi - Events Coordinator, Biomedicine</h3>
        <p>Hey my name is Sidorela but most people just call me Sid, and I’m a junior biomed major here at SJU. I am originally from Albania but moved to the US at a relatively young age. My goal ever since I was in high school was to go into research. Currently I am working in a lab that focuses on pulmonary toxicology which is important as ever especially due to COVID. I’m currently in the process of setting up my own independent undergraduate research project that focuses on nicotine and how it can be used as a potential treatment against inflammation and improve macrophage function; aka attempting making the argument that nicotine can be good for you! Outside of school and research work  I spend a lot of time helping out my family. I’ve also been attempting to get back into reading again since I’m not a big fan of T.V shows, but I spend more time buying books than reading them! </p>

        <h3>Madelaine starke - Fundraising Officer, Computer Science</h3>
        <p>Hello beautiful women! My name is Madelaine and I am currently a freshman studying computer science with a focus in business administration, hoping to add a finance minor next year. I took my first comp sci class in high school and loved it, and I am also really interested in the mathematical and problem solving aspects of coding. I am currently learning python and R and trying to build up a website with projects. Other than that I don’t have too much to offer in terms of career or research as of now, being a freshman and all, but I plan on going full force into finance or go into data science, or both. My hobbies include proving men wrong and girl bossing. I also like to shop for crystals, pet my cat, and go Marshall’s. I hope to see all you ladies back here for every meeting to spend time with the best eboard and the best members at sju!!</p>
