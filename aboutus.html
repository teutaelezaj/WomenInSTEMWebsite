           <h1>Teuta Elezaj - <span>President and Founder</span></h1>
         <p>
          Hi everyone! Thank you so much for checking out WIS SJU. My name is Teuta Elezaj and I am a rising senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. My parents immigrated here from Kosovo, making me a first generation American and college student. I originally enrolled into SJU as a biomedicine major, but, long story short, realized it wasn’t the path for me. It took me about a year and a half to have the guts to change my path, now that I have been a CS student for awhile, I couldn’t be happier with my decision. For a longer excerpt of my story, check out my blog post <a href="https://www.sjuacm.com/blog/TeutasPivotToComputerScience">here</a>. I have previously interned as a SWE and analyst, and am also the president of SJU ACM. Being that I have been in a couple of different STEM fields, and in high school I was also in a STEM program, I've been around men for the vast majority of my life and have been confronted with several different instances of misogynistic conduct and comments. I hope that this club can serve as a safe space for you all to thrive and succeed, and I want us to create an environment where motivation is a permanent feeling. My current career goal is to be a software engineer, and in the future I hope to integrate my passion for business with my coding abilities and have my very own grossly overvalued start-up (haha). Weightlifting is a huge passion of mine and in my free time, I'm usually working on a coding project (like this website!) or watching Survivor.

           <h1>Reyan Al Taee - <span>Vice President</span></h1>
           <p>Hey everyone! my name is Reyan and I’m a junior majoring in BioMedical Sciences. I got into St. John’s as a pharmacy major but while working at a pharmacy I realized I wanted to know beyond that this patient will be receiving this medication. I wanted to interact with patients and know what exactly is this drug doing to their system and if its not working what alternatives are available. I am also the public relations chair of the badminton club. I am currently working with professor Charles Fortmann, who is a physics professor that graduated from Stanford, teaching little kids physics at a school close to campus and soon will be working on his research that is making essential products from scratch that will be helping Puerto Rico to function day to day activities. I’m also pursuing a minor in psychology and that is mainly because I’m very intrigued by how the mind works. In all the extracurricular activities that I do, one thing I realized is the huge gap between men and women participation. I hope to see an increase in women in the research programs and so on. I love languages. I speak three languages and I am currently trying to learn Turkish. I love watching romance shows like Turkish series and k-dramas. I also love reading books, fiction as well as nonfiction. I love watching sunrises and sunsets and going on long drives alone. P.S. sunrises are prettier and calmer than sunsets! </p>

           <p>Hello everyone! My name is Sofya and I am a biology major with aspirations to work hands on in the medical field as a physician. I think it is necessary to break stereotypes of woman not being able to take control and lead the way in medicine . In my free time I love to work out and travel whenever there is time. I also work in a private medical office and I try my best to assist and get a look at the medical field to learn what needs to be adapted and changed for the greater good. I’m so glad to meet everyone and hopefully we can all make a change!</p>

          <h1>Marlin Medina - <span>Treasurer</span></h1>
          <p>Hi everyone! I’m Marlin and I’m a Computer Science major. I was born in the Dominican Republic but I grew up here in NY. I’ve really enjoyed learning to code and am looking forward to continue to grow in this field of study. This past summer I did an internship at a reinsurance company where I learned much about the industry and encountered many of the challenges that women face in male dominated fields. The truth is that most executive roles at companies are held by men and it can be pretty intimidating but I hope that this club can be a community where we can all talk about these challenges. In my free time I like to read, travel, bake and visit new places. Hope to meet you all soon! </p>

          <h1>Sidorela Zefi - <span>Events Coordinator</span></h1>
          <p>Hey my name is Sidorela but most people just call me Sid, and I’m a junior biomed major here at SJU. I am originally from Albania but moved to the US at a relatively young age. My goal ever since I was in high school was to go into research. Currently I am working in a lab that focuses on pulmonary toxicology which is important as ever especially due to COVID. I’m currently in the process of setting up my own independent undergraduate research project that focuses on nicotine and how it can be used as a potential treatment against inflammation and improve macrophage function; aka attempting making the argument that nicotine can be good for you! Outside of school and research work  I spend a lot of time helping out my family. I’ve also been attempting to get back into reading again since I’m not a big fan of T.V shows, but I spend more time buying books than reading them! </p>

          <p>Hello beautiful women! My name is Madelaine and I am currently a freshman studying computer science with a focus in business administration, hoping to add a finance minor next year. I took my first comp sci class in high school and loved it, and I am also really interested in the mathematical and problem solving aspects of coding. I am currently learning python and R and trying to build up a website with projects. I plan on going full force into finance or go into data science, or both. My hobbies include shopping for crystals, petting my cat, and going Marshall’s. I hope to see all you ladies back here for every meeting to spend time with the best eboard and the best members at sju!!</p>

          <p>Hello! My name is Sara Khan and I joined Women in STEM in hopes of finding a safe, creative space where I can feel utmost welcomed. I have always firmly believed a positive environment in which one puts themselves into will gradually impact their lives greatly. I love fueling female empowerment, especially unity among the STEM field. Additionally, I love to play tennis, travel, and learn about the human anatomy, specifically the brain! In the near future, I am hoping to pursue my academic endeavors in medical school, focusing on the surgical discipline of neurosurgery. Now, let’s get to empowering our STEM women, both on the local and global level! I look forward to seeing you all in the near future.</p>
