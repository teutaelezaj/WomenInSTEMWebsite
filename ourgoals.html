      <h1><span> Our </span>Goals</h1>
      <h2>An Oragnization Built by Women for Women in the STEM Sector</h2>
      <p align="left">What is WIS SJU trying to accomplish? Founded in September of 2021, Women in STEM is a club with a hefty list of goals. It is reported that women only comprise 29% of the STEM workforce, although we are 52% of the college-educated workforce. With this, women only make up 3% of STEM industry CEOs. </p>
      <p align="left"> - Through the power of awareness, these numbers have changed for the better in comparison to past times. In 1970, women made up 38% of all U.S. workers and 8% of STEM workers. By 2019, the STEM proportion had increased to 27% and women made up 48% of all workers </p>
      <p align="left"> - So what’s the deal? Why are there so few women in these fields? A multitude of factors has contributed to this low turnout rate, primarily misogyny embedded into our culture. </p>
      <p align="left"> - Women in STEM is unlike any other recognized organization at SJU for a few different reasons. Firstly, it would be the first and only organization that deals with the empowerment of women in a male-dominated field. With that, we would also be bringing in guest speakers to elaborate on their roles, how they got to the position they are in, and how we can begin to go down that path. It is a community of like-minded people networking in a safe space where motivation becomes a permanent feeling. WIS at SJU is fulfilling the need for female empowerment and the promotion of women in male-dominated fields. It will also help members perfect their interview skills and the way they network with powerful figures. </p>
      <h2>What We're Doing</h2>
      <p align="left"> - WIS at SJU intends on firstly bringing awareness to this issue and the complications that can arise from it. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women working full time make 81% what their male counterparts make. It could take another four decades to close the gender wage gap, according to projections from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, based on Census data—and it will take more than twice as long for women of color to reach parity. It is imperative that we begin to educate all genders on this prevalent issue in order to begin to bridge the gender gap in the STEM field. </p>
      <p align="left"> - In conjunction with awareness, we are seeking action. We have prepared guest speakers that are women in these fields to discuss the adversaries they have faced, how they overcame them, and overall serve as a motivational figure. This also serves as a safe networking space for all women to talk about issues they may feel uncomfortable speaking up on around men.</p>
      <p align="left"> - WIS at SJU also hopes to run charity throughout the semester and donate the earnings to institutions that deal with women's rights, education, and health. This is so that our impact goes past the SJU campus! </p>
