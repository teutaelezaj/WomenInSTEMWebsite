          <h3>Meeting w/ Anna Yeomans</h3>
          <p>We spoke to full-stack developer and solutions engineer Anna Yeomans about her unconventional journey into tech as a woman. She describes in detail how tech first piqued her interest, and from her advertisement degree, decided to take the leap and enrolled into Fullstack Academy Bootcamp. Here, she did 15 extensive weeks of coding and sharpened her collaboration and communication skills. She was then given a full-time position at CodeSignal! She provided valuable advice on how to break into tech as a woman.</p>

          <h3>Meeting w/ Dr. Mantell</h3>
          <p>Born and raised in China, Dr. Mantell received her training in the medical sciences at Beijing Medical University. She went on to earn her Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology at Stony Brook University. She then did her post-doctoral work with Dr. Carol Grieder (who won the 2009 Nobel Prize!) and then went to work at Winthrop University Hospital. Her research focuses on oxidative stress [an excess of pro-oxidants that can damage cells] as a side effect of mechanical ventilation, being especially prevalent in todayâ€™s times. This is just a very small glimpse into the incredible accomplishments achieved by Dr. Mantell, and we were given an immeasurable amount of advice and encouragement. </p>

          <h3>Networking w/ Each Other</h3>
          <p>In our second meeting, we all spoke about our experiences as women in STEM over cupcakes and games! The upperclassmen provided freshmen and sophomores with advice on how to do well in school, while also committing to extracurriular activities to make your resume stand-out. Advice on how to get into shadowing a physician, doing research work, and building your own coding projects was shared amongst one another. </p>
