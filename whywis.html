        <p>Although comprising 50% of the US workforce, women only make up about 27% of STEM workers. A multitude of factors has contributed to this low turnout rate—primarily misogyny embedded into our culture. Fields such as that of STEM are often stereotyped as male domains. A lack of female representation in these roles strays other young women from believing that this is something they can partake in. The purpose of the Women in STEM club is to share the diversity within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. We wish to promote the contributions women have made to the STEM fields, while encouraging more contributions in the future, from our members. </p> 
    
       <p>What is WIS SJU trying to accomplish? Founded in September of 2021, Women in STEM is a club with a hefty list of goals. It is reported that women only comprise 29% of the STEM workforce, although we are 52% of the college-educated workforce (NSF). With this, women only make up 3% of STEM industry CEOs. The social science sector has the highest percentage of women—64%, but with that being said, social science accounted for only 3% of STEM occupations. The largest portion of the STEM workforce is computer and engineering occupations (making up 80% of the STEM workforce) yet women represented only about a quarter of computer workers and 15% of those in engineering occupations. Women working in engineering occupations increased from 3% in 1970 to 15% in 2019. Although the percentage of women in computer occupations is higher than in 1970, it actually decreased between 1990 and 2019.</p> 
    
       <p>
        Through the power of spreading awareness, these numbers have changed for the better in comparison to past times. In 1970, women made up 38% of all U.S. workers and 8% of STEM workers. By 2019, the STEM proportion had increased to 27% and women made up 48% of all workers 
       </p>
       
       <p>
        So what’s the deal? Why are there so few women in these fields? A multitude of factors has contributed to this low turnout rate—primarily misogyny embedded into our culture. Fields such as that of STEM are often stereotyped as male domains. A lack of female representation in these roles strays other young women from believing that this is something they can partake in. Young women see few women going into science, technology, engineering, and math fields, so they have fewer role models and examples to follow. Despite this, the women that do end up become medical providers, software engineers, physicists, and so on, report experiencing adversaries in their workplace—often including sexual harassment, belittlement, and an overall un-welcoming community. The purpose of the Women in STEM club is to share the diversity within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. We wish to promote the contributions women have made to the STEM fields, while encouraging more contributions in the future, from our members. To combat this, WIS at SJU hopes to begin to bridge this gap in a few different ways. 
       </p>

       <p>
        Women in STEM is unlike any other recognized organization at SJU for a few different reasons. Firstly, it would be the first and only organization that deals with the empowerment of women in a male-dominated field. With that, we would also be bringing in guest speakers to elaborate on their roles, how they got to the position they are in, and how we can begin to go down that path. It is a community of like-minded people networking in a safe space where motivation becomes a permanent feeling. WIS at SJU is fulfilling the need for female empowerment and the promotion of women in male-dominated fields. It will also help members perfect their interview skills and the way they network with powerful figures. 
       </p>
      
      </div>

     <div class="Goals">
       <h1>Our<span> Goals</span></h1>
       <p>
        WIS at SJU intends on firstly bringing awareness to this issue and the complications that can arise from it. Studies show that a large portion of the population is ignorant to the adversaries women face that prevents them from pursing careers such as those in STEM. In fact, in a survey done by Equality Can’t Wait, 75% of people who took the survey believe that female workers are paid less than their male counterparts who do similar work. That may seem like a consensus, but only 62% of men held this belief, compared with 86% of women. This comes to no surprise, as men simply are not faced with these issues. To accompany this, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women working full time make 81% what their male counterparts make. It could take another four decades to close the gender wage gap, according to projections from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, based on Census data—and it will take more than twice as long for women of color to reach parity. It is imperative that we begin to educate all genders on this prevalent issue in order to begin to bridge the gender gap in the STEM field. 

        In conjunction with awareness, we are seeking action. We have prepared guest speakers that are women in these fields to discuss the adversaries they have faced, how they overcame them, and overall serve as a motivational figure. This also serves as a safe networking space for all women to talk about issues they may feel uncomfortable speaking up on around men. 
        
        WIS at SJU also hopes to run fundraisers throughout the semester and donate the earnings to charities that deal with women's rights, education, and health. This is so that our impact goes past the SJU campus!

     <div class="Mission">
      <h1>Our<span> Mission</span></h1>
       <p>
        As stated in the SJU mission statement, "We strive to preserve and enhance an atmosphere in which scholarly research, imaginative methodology, global awareness, and an enthusiastic quest for truth serve as the basis of a vital teaching-learning process and the development of lifelong learning". Our organization would be following these very goals--we wish to create a community of like-minded, motivated, and intelligent women who not only want to better themselves but those around them. Bringing in the element of fundraising for charity and educating ourselves on what women in different countries experience enhances our global awareness, whilst our guest speakers will serve as an enthusiastic way to begin our quests on becoming members of the STEM community. 
       </p>
     </div>

     <div class="Benefit">
      <h1>Our<span> Benefits</span></h1>
       <p>
        Our organization will benefit SJU students because it will serve as a community to anyone that is looking for advice, networking opportunities, or simply sitting in and seeing what we are all about. Already, many of our members have begun networking amongst themselves and making friends with like-minded people. Creating a space for people with similar goals to thrive in is something the entire university will greatly benefit from.
