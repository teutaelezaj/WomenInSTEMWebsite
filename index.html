    <h1><span>Women in STEM at </span>St. John's University</h1>
    <h2>An Oragnization Built by Women for Women in the STEM Sector</h2>
    <p align="left">Although comprising 50% of the US workforce, women only make up about 27% of STEM workers. 
      A multitude of factors has contributed to this low turnout rateâ€”primarily misogyny embedded into our
      culture. </p>
     <p align="left"> - Fields such as that of STEM are often stereotyped as male domains. </p>
     <p align="left"> - A lack of female representation in these roles strays other young women from believing that this is something they can 
      partake in. Young women see few women going into science, technology, engineering, and math fields, so
      they have fewer role models and examples to follow. </p>
     <p align="left"> - Despite this, the women that do end up becoming medical providers, software engineers, physicists, and so on, report experiencing adversaries in their workplace--often including sexual harassment, belittlement, and an overall un-welcoming community. </p>
     <p align="left"> - The purpose of the Women in STEM club is to share the diversity within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. We wish to promote the contributions women have made to the STEM fields, while encouraging more contributions in the future, from our members. </p>

        <h3>Work With Women Who Get It</h3>
        <p>WIS SJU is committed to providing only the best resources for our members. We have brought in women in the STEM sector to speak on their experiences in the field. With that, they provided valuable information on how to tackle female-focused issues on the field, and serve as incredibly motivating figures to us.  </p>

        <h3>Giving Back</h3>
        <p>We want our impact to go past the walls of St. John's. UNICEF reports that 129 million girls do not have access to education, and only 49 percent of countries have achieved gender parity in primary education. WIS is determined to do everything in our abilities to provide these women with educational resources through charity events.</p>

        <p>What better place to find like-minded women than in WIS? Surround yourself with a community of women who have similar career goals, whilst exposing yourself to different STEM pathways. Bounce off ideas with one another, collaborate on projects, and so much more.</p>

        <h3>Advance Your Career</h3>
        <p>WIS will be holding several events throughout the semester to help out as much as possible in advancing your career. This includes inviting guest speakers, holding information sessions, and educational seminars. We have also planned collaboration events with other clubs on campus to expand our impact.</p>
